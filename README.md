# ttyrex
I thought "T-Rex" would be a cool name for a terminal emulator since I really 
like PuTTY and KiTTY. The pronounciation doesn't work well when "tty" is at the 
beginning of the word, but oh well.

## Motivation
An experiment for me to understand how terminal emulators work.

This is written in C++ since that's what I use professionally and I enjoy 
exploring new features of the language.

## Progress
All the work happens on branches. On master you'll only find what I deemed
worthy of being there.

There's nothing runnable yet, but you can run some of the rudimentary unit
tests:
```console
$ bazel test //...
```
Again, the branches are where the bulk of the progress will live for a while.
